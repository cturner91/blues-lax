# blues-lax

A website for Walcountian Blues lacrosse club (project currently on hold pending funding ðŸ‘€).

## Spec

* Fully responsive - accessible on all phones / tablets / desktops
* Must provide info on:
  * Where to find us
  * When we train
  * How to contact key committee personnel
* Something that looks good and that can compete with other high profile lacrosse clubs in Southern England.
* Something that helps us stand out and will help attract players to the club.
  * **_Player profiles_** and **_match reports_** are differentiators here.
* Integrate with the main SEMLA website so that live league tables can be found (without us needing to maintain our own copy)
* If possible, some way for captains to record attendances to training to aid in team selection<sup>*</sup>.
* Some way to create graphics with team sheets ahead of fixtures<sup>*</sup>.

<sup>*</sup> Feature not currently developed, pending time constraints.

## Implementation

## Notes

This was my first standalone django project. And it had to be built within two weeks of evenings. It's fairly rough around the edges and requires a lot of improvement, but it works. 

_Imperfect but ready now is better than perfect but ready never._
