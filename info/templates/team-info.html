              <h2>SEMLA Premier Division</h2>
              <p>Our men's team compete in the SEMLA Premier Division, the highest level of lacrosse in the south of England. the men's team is a blend of experienced senior players and youthful recent graduates. The men's team made it to the semi-finals of the Senior Flags competition in the 2021-22 season, losing to eventual winners Spencer.</p>
              <p>The aim is for a top 3 finish in the 2022-23 season.</p>

              <h2>Local League</h2>
              <p>The men's team is also involved in the London Local League, division 2. These games are generally better-natured and a bit less competitive. Whether you're looking to push for silverware, or just looking for a runaround (and a pint after), you will have plenty of opportunities at Blues.</p>

              <h2>Match Info</h2>
              <p>Unless otherwise communicated, all men's games will be played on Saturdays with a 2pm face-off. Always aim to be at the venue at least an hour before face-off.</p>

              <h2>Training Info</h2>
              <p>The men's team train every week on <b>Tuesdays from 7.30pm-9.00pm</b>.</p>
              <p>We recognise that this time may not be suitable for everyone, but attendance to training is required for selection in matches. Exceptions can be made for pre-existing arrangements that cannot be changed (e.g. work), but these are the <b>exceptions</b> and not the norm. Players who wish to be selected regularly need to be training regularly.</p>

              <p>The women's 1s are currently ðŸ”¥ <b>on fire</b> ðŸ”¥ having just recently been crowned National Champions! They won their league for the first time since 2007 and then defeated Stockport 24-3 in the National Championship game, making them <u><a href='https://www.facebook.com/englacrosse/photos/pcb.5265157330209346/5265157266876019/'>#NattyChamps</a></u>.</p>
              <p>The women's 1s team is made up of a number of England internationals and a group of similarly motivated and talented players. If you're confident with a stick in your hand, and happy to bring those pozzy-vibes on gameday, then we would love to hear from you!</p>

              <h2>Match Info</h2>
              <p>Unless otherwise communicated, all women's 1s games will be played on Sundays with an 11am draw. Always aim to be at the venue at least an hour before the draw.</p>

              <p>You would think that as the women's 1s are so successful, that the 2s would be more a social team. But you would think <b>wrong</b>. Our women's 2s are also reigning <u><a href='https://www.facebook.com/englacrosse/photos/pcb.5264401103618302/5264401050284974/'>#NattyChamps</a></u>, beating Bristol Bombers in the Division 1 Championship game 16-5.</p>

              <p>There is always room on our 2s team for anybody who wants to develop their skills. Whether you're a new starter, or an experienced player who prefers to help lead on the pitch and develop others, we can promise gametime at an appropriate level on our women's 2s team.</p>

              <p>The women's 2s train every week on <b>Tuesdays from 7.30pm-9.00pm</b>.</p>
              <p>Players wishing to be selected regularly for the women's 2s team should be looking to train regularly. However, we recognise that people may have pre-existing commitments that cannot be changed (e.g. work). Each player who wants to play but cannot make training will be treated on a individual basis.</p>
